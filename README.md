Features:
- *Smooth Pin Animation*: The pin moves smoothly across the map, simulating a real-time tracking effect.
- *Interactive Map*: The map is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- *Customizable Path*: Easily configure different routes and paths for the pin to follow.
- *Responsive Design*: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for better user experience.
